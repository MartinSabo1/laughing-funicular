Overview
This repository contains the frontend code for our web application built with Next.js. Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy client-side routing, providing a great developer experience for building modern web applications.

Features
Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows us to render React components on the server side, improving performance and SEO.
Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits our JavaScript bundles, so each page only loads the JavaScript necessary for that page.
Client-side routing: Next.js provides built-in routing capabilities, making it easy to navigate between pages without a full page reload.
Static file serving: Next.js serves static assets, like images or CSS files, directly from the public directory.
API routes: Next.js allows us to create API routes easily, enabling us to build backend functionality directly within our frontend application.
